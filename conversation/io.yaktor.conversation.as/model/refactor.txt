Receivable{name,[type:Projection]}

PrivatelyReceivable extends Receivable

PubliclyReceivable{parent:Agent} extends Receivable
Sendable extends PubliclyReceivable

Transition.causedBy -> Transition.privatelyReceives
Transition.triggers -> Transition.sends

Validations to add:
1. Warning if Transition.sends.refType != Transition.privatelyReceives.refType && Transition.requiresExecution == false
2. Warning if Transition.sends.refType != Agent.type && Transition.mapping == null "Why aren't you specifying a mapping???"
3. Error if Transition t => t.publiclyReceives.refType == null && t.agent.projection != t.publiclyReceives.agent.projection "There is no incoming type to base a mapping on"
    ...change code so that scope provider for a Transition's mapping only provides list of t.publiclyReceives.refType's fields

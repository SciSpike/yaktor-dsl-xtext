Receivable{name,[type:Projection]}
PrivatelyReceivable extends Receivable
// Sendable
PubliclyReceivable{parent:Agent} extends Receivable
Sendable extends PubliclyReceivable

Agent.events -> Agent.sendables, then evaluate usages for correctness
Transition.causedBy -> Transition.privatelyReceives
Transition.triggers -> Transition.sends

Validations to add:
1. Warning if Transition.sends.refType != Transition.privatelyReceives.refType && Transition.requiresExecution == false
2. Warning if Transition.sends.refType != Agent.type && Transition.mapping == null
